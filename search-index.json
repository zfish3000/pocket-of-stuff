It works with a \u201cleader arm\u201d, which you control, and a \u201cfollower arm\u201d, which follows leader. Using this system, you can train the follower to pick up objects and do certain tasks. It can then recreate these tasks using an AI model."

It took me about a year to make it and it was finished March 2025. You can play it on itch.io . It was my first game with Godot, and I learned quite a bit while doing so. I taught myself GD Script, instantiation, shaders, particle systems, and a little bit of blender for the backgrounds."

    "body": "This Website! This website started out from inconvenience. All my ideas and projects were on this organizational program called Notion. So eventually the idea popped into my head that it would be quite convenient if I could turn my Notion pages directly into HTML for the website. Now, Notion does have it\u2019s own built in website publisher, but I didn\u2019t want to use that for two main reasons. I wanted to use my own domain name. I wanted to be able to style and customize the pages. I didn\u2019t want to pay extra to remove the Notion Watermark. So I decided to utilize the export as markdown function in Notion, and turn that into HTML suitable for this website. I created a python program which: Reads all the markdown files Defines page titles and URLs Rewrites the links between pages Rewrites image and video links Extract page metadata Renders an HTML page using Template files and a json file which links those templates to specific pages. Builds a search index. Copies and process assets. This essentially turns Notion into a CMS for me to use. If I ever want to change the content, all I need to do is write it in Notion, re-export, run it through the python program, and move the export into the pocket-of-stuff Github repo. Search was one of the hardest things to implement, and it uses Lunr.js. When building the website, the built script creates a file called search-index.json. The browser then loads that index and uses Lunr.js to search for content. Try out Notion, its well designed, easy to use, and completely free with most features."

It\u2019s my first 3D game and I used blender to create the models. The main problem I\u2019m having with this game is focusing more on the art than the gameplay. It started as a random test for procedural generation, and slowly evolved into the strategy game it is today. I\u2019m still working on it, but I\u2019m hoping to release it by summer 2026."

Its running the RetroPie, a package containing emulation software for Raspberry Pi computers. I configured it to run arcade games with Mame, NES, SEGA Master, and N64 games. It was made from a kit with laser-cut plywood pieces. This is the first \u201cbig\u201d project I did, combining a bunch of skills. I used mild woodworking skills to glue these pieces together, graphic design skills for the intro video and signs, and some soldering for the electronics (which I\u2019m still not very good at). All in all it was a fun project and I think it adds a lot of life to my room"
